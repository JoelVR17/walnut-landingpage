                                        <strong>Be early to Starknet and become an OG.</strong> After announcing Walnut, we received strong interest from top Starknet companies like Argent, Briq or StarknetID. Building Walnut presents an opportunity to collaborate with the top devs on Starknet, solve their problems, build friendships, and get deep into the ecosystem.

                                <h2>About Walnut</h2>
                                <p>
                                    We are a team of (currently) two developers building Walnut: a web-based debugger for Starknet transactions. We mostly deal with Rust on the backend and React / NextJS on the frontend. Our work also touches the Cairo Compiler and Cairo VM, which we need to tweak to generate the debug information required by the debugger.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    From a high level, the Walnut architecture involves running a custom node with a forked and enhanced Cairo VM and Compiler, capable of generating the necessary debug information. We have a front-end app, https://app.walnut.dev/, where users can paste transactions. The front end then sends a query to our backend, which reruns the transaction using our modified node to generate the necessary debug info. Finally, the server returns the debug info back to the client to present the debugger UI.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We are also behind <Link href="https://cairovm.codes/">cairovm.codes</Link>, a web-based playground for learning and debugging Cairo programs and exploring the Cairo VM execution trace. The app has been recognized by Starkware and is in the process of being integrated into the official documentation of Starknet.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We are VC-backed and have a healthy runway. We are not just another ‚Äúcrazy-excited‚Äù, ‚Äúmove-fast-and-change-direction-every-day‚Äù, ‚ÄúVC-backed-and-soon-to-die‚Äù startup. We have been around for a while and have experienced our fair share of successes and failures. We are well-capitalized and committed for the long term.

                                    You will spend approximately 100% of your time building Walnut. The only meetings we conduct are standups and bi-weekly retrospectives. Among other responsibilities, you will:

                                        Work on the Node infrastructure to ensure its stability.

                                    <li>
                                        Work on the Backend code (written in Rust) that simulates (reruns) transactions and generates debug information.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Work on the frontend code (React + Next) of the debugger. Note: UI skills are not expected here; we have that covered. :)

                                </ul>

                                <p>
                                In addition, you will also be involved in regular experiments to learn new things. The next one we are planning is a two-week exploration project to ideate and build a debugger MVP for the app-chain future, where there are thousands of chains. This future poses a problem to our current architecture, as we need to rerun every transaction to get the debug data. In the experiment, we aim to explore some solutions to this problem.
                                </p>
