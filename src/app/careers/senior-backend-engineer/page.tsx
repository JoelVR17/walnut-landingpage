                                        <strong>Build a product people will actually use and love.</strong> After announcing Walnut at the end of 2023 during StarkNet Istanbul (and <Link href="https://x.com/Starknet/status/1724865566303821948?s=20">winning the hackathon ðŸ™Œ</Link>), we received strong interest from top StarkNet companies such as <Link href="https://argent.xyz/">Argent</Link>, <Link href="https://briq.construction/">Briq</Link>, and <Link href="https://starknet.id/">StarknetID</Link>. They all said they &quot;definitely need a transaction debugger for their day-to-day&quot; and are waiting for V1 to go live.

                                    We are a team of two developers seeking to hire two more backend developers to join our ranks. Expect a team of four buildersâ€”an ideal group to create a new product, ship quickly, and iterate effectively.
                                </p>

                                    From a high level, the Walnut architecture involves a Backend that is capable of forking the Starknet blockchain and rerunning (simulating) transactions with a customized Cairo VM and Compiler in order to generate debug information for the transaction runtime. It communicates with a Front-End web app, <Link href="https://app.walnut.dev">https://app.walnut.dev</Link>, where users can paste transaction hashes and get the ability to debug those transactions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We are also building <Link href="https://cairovm.codes/">cairovm.codes</Link>, a web-based playground for learning and debugging Cairo programs and exploring the Cairo VM execution trace. The app has been recognized by Starkware and is in the process of being integrated into the official documentation of Starknet.

                                    We are VC-backed and have a healthy runway. We are not just another &quot;crazy-excited&quot;, &quot;move-fast-and-change-direction-every-day&quot;, &quot;VC-backed-and-soon-to-die&quot; startup. We have been around for a while and have experienced our fair share of successes and failures.

                                    In addition, you will also be involved in regular experiments to learn new things. The next experiment we are planning is a two-week exploration project to ideate and build an MVP for a debugger that would support thousands of chains. Our current architecture will struggle with large numbers of chains due to the requirement to rerun transactions for each one. In the experiment, we aim to explore multiple solutions to solve this problem.
